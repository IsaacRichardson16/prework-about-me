      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I have too many hobbies to keep track of. I've played hockey my entire life and still play now. I love riding my street motorcycle and dirt bike with my friends. My love of motorcycles has trasformed into a need to work on them mechanically. I love gaming and building gaming PCs. And a newer hobby of mine is going out onto the golf course and trying lose as little golf balls as possible.</p>

      <p>Easily a professional hockey player!</p>

      <p>In the Avenues in Salt Lake City Utah</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>Tech is always something I have been interested in. I worked as an Account Executive for a few big tech companies in Silicone Slopes, and I made a few friends with the developers and learned more about what they do and loved it!</p>
